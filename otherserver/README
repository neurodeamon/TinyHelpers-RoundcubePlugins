Plugin description
###################
If you use a list of predefined hosts, but still want to manually use other hosts,
then this plugin is what you probably ever wanted!

!!! Beware !!!
!!! This plugin only works if your theme uses the same html (id/name).
!!! If you messed with the html and didn't style your login page through CSS,
!!! then you need to adjust this plugin to your needs. (through otherserver.js)
!!! the jQuery JS framework is also needed !

Installation
#############

Upload the unzipped plugin folder to your roundcube plugin directory and activate it in
the roundcube configuration file (config/main.inc.php).

i.E.:

// List of active plugins (in plugins/ directory)
$rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('otherserver');
