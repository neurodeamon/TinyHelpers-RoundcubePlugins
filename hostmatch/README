Plugin description
###################
This plugin works flawlessly with the "otherserver" plugin and any standard roundcube installation.
If you youse predefined hosts then this plugin is a MUST HAVE.
While you enter your username (works only with email adresses as username) the correct host in the dropdown is selected.

i.e. You have defined hosts like:
"Gmail" pointing to "ssl://imap.gmail.com"
"yahoo" pointing to "ssl://imap.mail.yahoo.com"

then typing "yourname@gmail.com" will autoselect the gmail host.
This is done by checking the "domain" part of the username "yourname@hostname.tld".
Simple but works!

!!! Beware !!!
!!! This plugin only works if your theme uses the same html (id/name).
!!! If you messed with the html and didn't style your login page through CSS,
!!! then you need to adjust this plugin to your needs. (through otherserver.js)
!!! the jQuery JS framework is also needed !

Installation
#############

Upload the unzipped plugin folder to your roundcube plugin directory and activate it in
the roundcube configuration file (config/main.inc.php).

i.E.:

// List of active plugins (in plugins/ directory)
$rcmail_config['plugins'] = array('hostmatch');
